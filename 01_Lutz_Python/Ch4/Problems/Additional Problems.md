# Additional Questions
## 1.) Using **csv** similar to examples 1 and 2, read data1.txt into a nested list and print it out.

## 2.) Using **csv**, read data2.txt into a nested list of floats.  If there is any data missing, a zero should be written.  Letting L by the nested list,
```python
>>>print(L)  

[[1.0, 101.0], [2.0, 2001.0], [3.0, 301.0], [4.0, 401.0], [5.0, 0], [6.0, 0], [7.0, 701.0]]
```

## 3.) Again using **csv**, read data3.txt into a dictionary with the first column as the key, then with a nested list, with each row of data in the sheet as a list of floats in the dictionary  With D as the dictionary, 
```python
>>>print(D['Apple'][1])  

[2.0, 2.00001]
```
